% This script intends to find the optimum motion ratio given a chosen
% damper and desired wheel rate. The idea behind this optimization is to
% place the damper's middle click exactly at the place where average
% contact patch load variation is minimized. This way, the adjustability of
% this damper is maximized, as there's equal headroom on both sides when
% adjustment is needed.

title("Min CPL vs. Motion Ratio")
% Here, the minimum CPL is the smallest wheel load the car sees on the
% shaker given a typical road input, this usually happens when the car is
% at its unsprung mode. The reason why this is considered alongside the RMS
% CPLV is that you don't want a car that surpresses everything really well
% but then gives a super huge primary mode oscillation. This metric is more
% tied to the performance of the vehicle under large body movement such as
% straight line max braking and step steer.

title("Hub Pitch vs. Motion Ratio")
% "Hub pitch" is the difference between the front and rear unsprung mass
% displacement at any given time. This is important because the test input
% is pure heave. A strong pitch correlates to uneven motion of the front
% and rear wheel, indicating a mismatch in stiffness or damping.
